== README

This blog is for the Coursera class "Web Application Architectures", March 2015.

This is the first iteration. I have generated scaffolds for the posts and comments. I have followed the instructor's directions exactly except for the following:
1. I have changed the README from .rdoc to .md (Bitbucket doesn't like .rdoc) and added my own content.
2. I have placed config/secrets.yml in the .gitignore file.
