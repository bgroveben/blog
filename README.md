== README

This blog is for the Coursera class "Web Application Architectures", March-May 2015.

I have followed the instructor's directions exactly except for the following:

1. I have changed the README from .rdoc to .md (Bitbucket doesn't like .rdoc) and added my own content.

2. I have placed config/secrets.yml in the .gitignore file.

3. I have stored the code on Github as well as Bitbucket.
