== README

This blog is for the Coursera class "Web Application Architectures", March 2015.

This is the first iteration. I have generated scaffolds for the posts and comments. I have followed the instructor's directions exactly except for the following:

1. I have changed the README from .rdoc to .md (Bitbucket doesn't like .rdoc) and added my own content.

2. I have placed config/secrets.yml in the .gitignore file.

3. I have stored the code on Github as well as Bitbucket.

Module 6 Completed

All quizzes and programming assignments 1 and 2 are finished.

Waiting for the grading program to be updated before I submit assignments 3 (master branch) and 4 (iteration5) again. Push master for assignment 3 first, then merge iteration5 to master and push for assignment 4.
